## Basic setup

Here's how to set up a tweet card with basic information:

<Playground>
    <Container>
        <TweetCard
            author={{ 
                name: 'randy', 
                username: 'randyfactory', 
                image: 'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1382083582752096262/xrx0PO8Z_400x400.jpg' 
            }}
            tweet={
                `how was “philosopher” ever a job lmao like was socrates sippin wine on a balcony somewhere drunkenly slurring shit like “to find urself, think for urself” with a crowd cheering underneath him like fuck yes socrates another banger this man will not miss`
            }
            time={new Date(2021, 2, 2, 21, 3)}
            source="Twitter for iPhone"
            permalink="https://twitter.com/randyfactory/status/1366841622495961091" // optional
            fitInsideContainer
        />
    </Container>
</Playground>

## Tweet author options

You can specify that the author of the tweet you're displaying in the card is either verified or protected (private). 
The verified badge will show next to the user's name for verified users, and the padlock icon for protected users.
To add these properties, add `isVerified: true` or `isProtected: true` to the `author` prop.

<Playground>
    <Container>
        <TweetCard
            author={{ 
                name: '50cent', 
                username: '50cent', 
                image: 'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1226895461941940224/hBx6tZxz_400x400.jpg',
                isVerified: true, // try replacing this with "isProtected" 
            }} 
            tweet={
                `I just looked at kanye page what the fuck kind a spaced out tweets are those. fuck that I aint never looking at that shit again`
            }
            time={new Date(2010, 7, 28, 18, 36)}
            source="ÜberSocialOrig"
            permalink="https://twitter.com/50cent/status/22366597012"
            fitInsideContainer
        />
    </Container>
</Playground>
